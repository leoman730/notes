# Notes
Notes is a website aims at providing a web presence to display my personal interests and focus in life. Simply put, it is a personal website.

There are 2 primary objectives for this project:  
1. Share lessons I learn through everyday life experience in both technical and non-technical terms to perspective audiences.
2. Serve as technical playground where I can exercise various new web technologies.

Nothing fancy or complex. Only a simple equation that I truly believe in:
