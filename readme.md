# Notes
Notes is a website aims at providing a web presence to display my personal interests and focus in life. To simply put, this is a personal website.

Two primary objectives for this project:

1. Share lessons that I have learnt through everyday experience to the prospective audiences. Both in technical and non-technical terms.

2. Serve as a technical playground where I can exercise various new web technologies.

Nothing fancy or complicated. Only a simple equation that I honestly believe in:
